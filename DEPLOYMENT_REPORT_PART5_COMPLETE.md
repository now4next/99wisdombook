## 📋 Part 5 Summary: Communication & Information

### Overarching Themes
1. **Power of Words** (Ch 45-48): How language shapes reality
2. **Leadership & Decision-Making** (Ch 49-50): Group dynamics and authority
3. **Self-Awareness & Limits** (Ch 51-52): Blind spots and strategic ignorance

- **We need others**: Self-objectivity is structurally impossible
- **Less can be more**: Strategic ignorance is wisdom in the information age
- **Silence is powerful**: Non-verbal communication often speaks louder

### Connecting Wisdom Across Chapters:
Part 5 teaches a profound lesson about **intentionality in communication**:
- Know the **weight** of your words (Ch 45-46)
- Know **when** to speak and when to listen (Ch 49, 53)
- Know **what** you need to know and what you don't (Ch 52)
