    <h2>The Sweet Bait and the Inevitability of the Invoice</h2>

    <p class="first-paragraph">
      From the moment of birth, human beings are engaged in transaction. Even that first, piercing cry that fills a
      newborn’s lungs with air consumes energy. We are constantly giving something up to gain something else. We trade
      our time to earn money, and then trade that money to purchase comfort. We dedicate our youth to acquire wisdom,
      and sometimes, we mortgage our health in the pursuit of success. Yet, in the face of this cold, transactional law,
      humanity persistently dreams a futile dream: the craving for something "free."
    </p>

    <blockquote>"This is complimentary."</blockquote>

    <p>
      This short sentence is perhaps the most powerful incantation to paralyze human reason. In front of a sample
      station at the supermarket, a free sign-up page on a website, or a seemingly selfless favor from an acquaintance,
      we lower our guard. However, the history of mankind—and indeed, the laws of the universe—state firmly: in the
      truest sense, "free" does not exist in this world. If it appears that no one has paid a price, it simply means the
      invoice is being delivered with a time delay, has been transferred to a third party, or is being paid in a form of
      value invisible to the naked eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Chapter 1, we uncover the truth behind the proposition that "there is no such thing as a free lunch"—humanity’s
      oldest wisdom and the absolute law governing both economics and nature.

    <h2>The Salty Ham and Beer of the 19th Century American West</h2>

    <p>
      Where did the famous adage, "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch," originate? Let us turn the clock back to
      the late 19th century, to the era of the American frontier.
    </p>

    <p>
      At that time, saloons stretching from New Orleans to San Francisco were bustling with laborers. To lure in these
      men, exhausted from rough work, saloon owners devised a brilliant marketing scheme. They hung large signs outside
      their establishments:
    </p>

    <blockquote>"Buy one beer, get lunch for free!"</blockquote>

    <p>
      For impoverished workers, this was a miraculous offer. For the price of a single beer—mere nickels—they could
      feast on a plate piled high with roast beef, ham, cheese, bread, and crackers. People flocked in droves, praising
      the owner as a philanthropist. However, hidden within this "free lunch" was a meticulously calculated trap.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every item of food provided was excessively salty. The ham was cured in brine, the crackers were salted, and the
      pungent cheese induced thirst. The more of the free appetizers the patrons ate, the more parched they became.
      There was only one way to quench that burning thirst: order more beer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, customers ended up drinking two or three times more than usual, and the saloon owner earned massive
      profits that far exceeded the cost of the snacks. What the customers consumed was not a "free lunch." They paid
      for it dearly with their health, their drunkenness, and an inflated tab for alcohol. This anecdote lays bare the
      essence of commercialism wrapped in the packaging of "free." When the visible price tag reads "zero," we are
      paying the price with something other than our wallets.

    <h2>Milton Friedman and the Discovery of Opportunity Cost</h2>

    <p>
      Nobel laureate in Economics, Milton Friedman, elevated this saloon anecdote to the golden rule of economics by
      adopting it as the title of his 1975 book. He warned that government welfare policies and free services are never
      truly "free."
    </p>

    <p>
      economically, this phrase is explained through the concepts of <strong>Scarcity</strong> and
      <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>. Resources are finite. Time, money, and labor are not infinite. Therefore, the
      act of making a choice inevitably means giving up another possibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose you say to a friend, "Dinner is on me tonight!" and pay for the meal. Is that meal free for your friend?
      Economically speaking, no. To attend that dinner, your friend has "paid" with the time they could have spent
      resting at home, meeting someone else, or catching up on work.
    </p>

    <p>
      The national economy operates the same way. When a government implements "free healthcare" or "free school meals,"
      doctors and farmers are not volunteering their services for free. The cost ultimately comes from the taxpayers'
      pockets. If I do not pay for it now, it remains as debt (government bonds) that future generations must repay.
